## Short answers/questions ##

### 1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project? ###
   
The need we are addressing in our project is to assist recruiters in determining when currently contracted workers finish their contracts, based upon their end dates. This is not currently the feature of The major platforms including LinkedIN..etc. 

### 2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving? ###
  
The problem we are trying to solve by building this marketplace App is; as information about contact timeline and skill levels of workers are not generally available on other platforms, we will be linking the recruiters with Web Developers and Software Programmers.

### 3. Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the needs. ###

The project we’ve undertaken will be giving recruiters access to our database, which contains relevant information about contractors and their end dates. Currently they have to contact candidates regarding when they will finish their contracts.
